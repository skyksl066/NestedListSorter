This project demonstrates a sortable nested list feature implemented in JavaScript using jQuery. The nested list can be dynamically sorted based on numerical values. The button 'Sort List' triggers the sorting function.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the 'Sort List' button to see the nested list sorted in the adjacent column.

Feel free to explore and integrate this feature into your projects! #"
