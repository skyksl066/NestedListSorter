# Sorted Nested List

This project demonstrates a sortable nested list feature implemented in JavaScript using jQuery. The nested list can be dynamically sorted based on numerical values. The button 'Sort List' triggers the recursive sorting function, allowing an infinite depth of sorting for each nested level.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the 'Sort List' button to see the nested list sorted in the adjacent column.

Feel free to explore and integrate this feature into your projects! #
